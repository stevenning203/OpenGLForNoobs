            All this does is create a window that opens. If you've ever done any game development at all, you know that we have to use
            a loop in order to draw our images and take inputs every single frame. For OpenGL, we have to clear the buffers, poll events,
            and then update the display. The functions that we use are:
            <div id = "code">
                <pre>
                    <code class = "language-cpp">
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT); // clear the internal buffers that are used by OpenGL
glfwSwapBuffers(window); // swap the front and the back buffers
glfwPollEvents(); // poll events, such as a window movement or a window close.
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            A buffer is just space created for data. Every frame, the internal buffers used by OpenGL are filled with data that is used when
            the frame is being drawn, which needs to be cleared every frame or else the data might be the same between frames. Swapping
            the front and the back buffer is just a way of saying that the display is updated. The front buffer is the buffer containing
            the pixel data which is displayed on your screen, and the back buffer is the buffer containing the pixel data that you wrote
            to to create the next frame.<br><br>

            We also need to poll events because this tells Windows that the window is still responding, and also does things like allow
            the resizing, movement, and closing of the window.<br><br>

            All three of these function calls are placed in a while loop that checks if the program should exit:
            <div id = "code">
                <pre>
                    <code class = "language-cpp">
while(!glfwWindowShouldClose(window))
{
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT); // clear the internal buffers that are used by OpenGL

    //render here

    glfwSwapBuffers(window); // swap the front and the back buffers
    glfwPollEvents(); // poll events, such as a window movement or a window close.
}
glfwTerminate(); // kill all windows and terminate
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>

        <p>
            That's great! We have the loop and the init functions down, but how do we draw?<br><br>
            <b>OpenGL's pipeline</b><br><br>
            A <b>pipeline</b> is the stuff that we need to do from beginning to end in order to accomplish what we want. OpenGL deals with buffers
            quite a bit, so understanding them is vital to your success in understanding OpenGL. Your graphics card has video memory which can be
            segmented into buffers that can be filled with respective data. Why does a graphics chip have its own memory? It's because of speed.
            Memory right there on the graphics card is much faster to access by the graphics processing chip. For example, a GTX 1080 has a memory
            bandwith of 320 gigabytes per second, while a given pair of memory sticks may only have a bandwidth of around 15 gigabytes per second.
            The extremely fast transfer of large amounts of data is imperative to computer graphics because of the requirement of speed.<br><br>

            These buffers on the GPU can hold many things, like vertices, textures, and more. We'll begin first with a vertex buffer. This is
            a buffer that holds the vertex data. That is, data containing each point of the shapes we want to draw. In OpenGL, it is very common
            practice to use solely triangles, because they are the most elementary non-degenerate two-dimensional shape, meaning that all two-dimensional
            shapes without curves can be represented congruently with triangles, although curves can be approximated with a large amount of vertices.<br><br>

            In a rendering tool such as Pygame, from Python, the plane used to draw points is very simple, where the top left of the screen is (x = 0, y = 0),
            and the bottom right of the screen is (x = w, y = h). However, OpenGL uses a plane called the Normalized Device Coordinate plane, where the bottom
            left of the screen is always (x = -1, y = -1), and the top right of the screen is always (x = 1, y = 1). You might wonder how this could be possible,
            since windows can vary in sizes, but that will be covered later. Right now, we can create an array of floats that represent the vertices of some
            triangle that we want to draw. We include a z coordinate that doesn't do anything because it makes it easier to transition into 3D later.
            <div id = "code">
                <pre>
                    <code class = "language-cpp">
float vertices = 
{
    -1.f, -1.f, 0.f, // the first vertex of the triangle at (-1, -1)
    1.f, -1.f, 0.f, // the second vertex of the triangle at (1, -1)
    0.f, 1.f, 0.f // the third vertex of the triangle at (0, 1)
};
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            This array has the vertices of our triangle. Note that the vertices are in counter-clockwise order because of something called backface culling,
            where triangles are only draw on one side, which is the side where the vertices are in counter-clockwise order. This is for performance
            reasons since the program only has to draw half the triangles with backface culling on. So what exactly is the pipeline of OpenGL?<br><br>

            OpenGL's pipeline involves uploading the data into the buffers in the GPU, telling the GPU how to use this data, and then telling the GPU
            to draw using the buffers. You'll probably have around one buffer per model, so that you can apply unique transformations onto each model
            as you require. The first thing we need to do is tell the GPU that we want some memory for a buffer. Then we have to "bind" the buffer,
            which is a way of saying that any operations done next are referring to that specific buffer. A vertex buffer in OpenGL is commonly
            referred to as a vertex buffer object (VBO). Note that the code that follows is done outside of the loop, right after our
            declaration of the vertices.
            <div id = "code">
                <pre>
                    <code class = "language-cpp">
unsigned int VBO;
glGenBuffers(1, &VBO); // create the space for the vertices we want to upload to the GPU
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBO); // bind the VBO and tell OpenGL that it is a buffer for an array
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 2 * 3 * sizeof(float), &vertices[0], GL_STATIC_DRAW);
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            The last line, glBufferData..., uploads the data to the buffer. You may have noticed that there are 2 arguments that you don't know yet, which are
            "2 * 3 * sizeof(float)", and "GL_STATIC_DRAW". The first of the two arguments tells OpenGL how big the data is in bytes. For us, it would be
            two floats per vertex, three vertices, and 4 bytes per float. The latter argument tells OpenGL how we are going to use the data in the buffer.
            This is important because the argument we choose is important to the performance when we do things with the buffer. STATIC means that the buffer
            is modified once but used a lot of times, STREAM would mean that it is only used a few times and modified once, while DYNAMIC means that the buffer
            is going to be modified many times and used many times. DRAW means that we want to use the data in the buffer to draw objects, while a READ would
            mean that we want to use it later, and COPY would mean that it is used to draw but the data is not specified by the application.<br><br>
            For our purposes, GL_STATIC_DRAW is the best one to use. This is because we write to the buffer once, and then are going to draw it once every frame.
            If we wanted to change the buffer for some reason, we might use GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW instead. The next thing we have to do is tell OpenGL how the data in the
            buffer is organized. This is done because the data is transferred to the shader, where we will use it to do operations and draw our vertices.<br><br>
            <b>Shaders</b><br><br>
            A shader is a program that runs on the GPU instead of the CPU. This is where calculations in regards to vertices and colouring are done. The language
            that OpenGL uses to write its shaders is called GLSL and is very similar to C. There are unique tokens and functions that are specific to GLSL so
            we have to learn those in order to effectively learn GLSL. For now, all you need to know is that there are two shaders, the vertex shader and the fragment shader.<br><br>
            <b>Vertex Shader</b><br><br>
            The vertex shader's job is to use the vertices put in by the buffers and then do some operations to output a variable "gl_Position". This is the normalized
            device coordinate that is drawn to the screen. You may wonder, what exactly makes OpenGL a 3D rendering tool instead of a 2D? Interestingly, OpenGL doesn't
            exactly have any inherent ability to draw in three dimensions. All OpenGL can do in regards to drawing is draw many triangles very quickly. Right now, we are
            going to focus on 2D so that we can easily understand the OpenGL pipeline.<br><br>
            <b>Fragment Shader</b><br><br>
            In OpenGL, colouring is done through fragments, where each "fragment" is a portion of the triangle being drawn. There will be at least one fragment for each pixel.
            The fragment shader is capable of taking texture samples to find the pixel colour that is needed at any specific fragment. This is where textures come from. We'll,
            for now, just output one colour so that the triangle will be one solid colour. To write a shader, we have to write a shader parser in C++ that will take our shader
            file and convert it into a char array, which will then be given to OpenGL to be used as the shader. Our shader right now is very simple, and you can probably write
            a shader parser without help, so I will just make the shaders const char * for now:
            <div id = "code">
                <pre>
                    <code class = "language-cpp">
const char * vertex_shader_source = "#version 330 core\n layout(location = 0) in vec3 vertex_position;\nvoid main()\n{\ngl_Position = vec4(vertex_position, 1.f);\n}";

// the shader actually looks like this:

#version 330 core

layout(location = 0) in vec3 vertex_position;

void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(vertex_position, 1.f);
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            The #version line tells OpenGL which GLSL version we want. Since we are using core OpenGL 3.3, we tell it that it is version 330 core. The next line has to do
            with the vertex buffer. It just says that for this buffer, with an ID of location = 0, we take in vertex positions that are in the form of 3 component vectors.
            In main is where the actual code to be executed is written. We have to set gl_Position to a vector with 4 components, not 3, so we just take the original vector
            and add a one on to the end.

            In the fragment shader, GLSL takes colours as a 3 length vector with red, green, and blue normalized between 0 and 1. That means that no red at all means a value
            of 0 for red, and full red would be a value of 1. We actually have to say that we want a vector going out for the fragment shader, so we do that by declaring
            out and then a value. Here is the simple fragment shader (of course, this is the parsed version.)
            <div id = "code">
                <pre>
                    <code class = "language-cpp">
#version 330 core

out vec3 fragment_color;

void main()
{
    fragment_color = vec3(1.f, 0.25f, 0.1f);
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            The fragment shader declares first that there is a vector of length 3 that will go out, and then sets the vector to a vec3 of full red, part blue, and part green.
            This fragment shader just sets all fragments to this colour. If we were using textured objects, we would sample a texture here, and also calculate things
            like lighting.<br><br>

            We still haven't finished with our vertex buffer yet. We have to call the function glVertexAttribPointer() in order to declare how the vertices are organized.
            The function glVertexAttribPointer() needs 6 arguments : glVertexAttribPointer(unsigned int index, int size, type, bool normalized, int stride, void * pointer);
            The index is the offset of where the actual data starts. For us, that would be 0, since the start of the buffer is where the data starts. Size is the amount of
            items to be combined into a vector. In our vertex shader, the line "layout (location = 0) in vec3 vertex_position" means that it is a vec3, or there are 3 items
            per vector. So that argument is 3. For type, the items in our array are floats, but we want to use a OpenGL enum for this argument, which is GL_FLOAT. Normalized
            is asking if it is normalized, so we just say GL_FALSE, because it is not normalized. The stride is the amount of bytes that the program has to jump in order to reach
            the next item in the buffer. Since each item in the array is a float, this would be the size of a float, or sizeof(float). Because our array is just vertex positions and
            nothing else, we don't have to deal with the pointer so we can just say (void*)0 for that argument.<br><br>

            Additionally, we need to associate the function we just called with an index, which is in "location = 0" for the vertex shader. The function we use is "glEnableVertexAttribArray".
            The only argument it asks for is an integer which is the location, so we just put a 0 in there. These functions are called right after we use glBufferData().
            Our final calls in regards to attributes for our buffer is:
            <div id = "code">
                <pre>
                    <code class = "language-cpp">
glEnableVertexAttribArray(0); // same as layout(location = i), where i is 0 in our case
glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, sizeof(float), (void*)0);
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we are very close to being able to draw the triangle. All we have to do is call the draw function every loop. The function we are going to use is
            glDrawArrays().
        </p>
