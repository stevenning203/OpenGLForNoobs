            <b>What is OpenGL For Noobs(OGLFN)</b><br><br>
            Hi! This is OpenGL For Noobs! <br><br>
            This is a resource I created to help noobies who know C++ pretty well who want to learn OpenGL. I'm a learner, just like you, and in the beginning, I struggled
            with OpenGL. I felt that for new adventurers like me, the current resources like LearnOpenGL or opengl-tutorial didn't give enough on theory and understanding exactly
            what you were doing when you were creating your project. And so I created my own! This specific resource is created tailored towards people new to computer
            graphics and the OpenGL pipeline.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>What will we do in OGLFN?</b><br><br>
            This resource will be worked on me when I want to. I will cover all the basics you need to create your own game or game engine using what you have learned from
            this resource. If you want to learn more in-depth or just want to learn from a more advanced resource, I recommend The Cherno on YouTube or a website like
            LearnOpenGL or opengl-tutorial. Those resources are the ones I've used to learn OpenGL, and they are good resources.
