            <b>What is OpenGL?</b><br><br>
            OpenGL is a rendering API which allows us to communicate with graphics units in order to produce high performance computer graphics. It is not a library,
            and it is not as simple as <b>#include</b> ing a single header. We will need multiple libraries in order to do what we want with OpenGL. Here they are:
            <div id = "code">
                <pre>
                    <code class = "language-cpp">
#include "assimp/Importer.hpp"
#include "assimp/scene.h"
#include "assimp/postprocess.h"
#include "stb_image.h"
#include "glad.h"
#include "GLFW/glfw3.h"
#include "glm/glm.hpp"
#include "glm/gtc/matrix_transform.hpp"
#include "glm/gtc/type_ptr.hpp"
#include "glad.c"

#include &ltstring>
#include &ltfstream>
#include &ltvector>
#include &ltsstream>
#include &ltiostream>
#include &ltctime>
#include &ltstdlib.h>
#include &ltunordered_map>
#include &ltstdio.h>
#include &ltWindows.h>
#include &ltshellapi.h>
#include &ltmath.h>
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a bunch of headers. First let's start with the most crucial: glad and glfw.<br><br>
            <b>glad</b><br><br>
            glad is a header that gets function pointers for OpenGL functions. Since there are many OpenGL versions that have many
            different functions, we have to retrieve them somehow. This is done through glad. glad loads all the functions
            that we will use in order to draw what we want. However, all glad does is load the functions we need to actually
            <strong>DRAW</strong> the shapes and colour them. To create our window context and have input methods, we use glfw.<br><br>
            <strong>Graphics Library Framework (glfw)</strong><br><br>
            glfw allows us to create our window that we will render to and process input like mouse input and keyboard input. This includes things such as
            mouse position, keyboard presses, and mouse clicks. It is essential to us being able to create the window and process input.<br><br>
            Strictly speaking, the next headers are not necessary, but they make our lives much, much easier.<br><br>
            <b>GL Mathematics (glm)</b><br><br>
            glm is a header that includes many math tools we can use to help create what we want. It includes matrices, vectors, and
            functions that allow us to manipulate matrices and vectors. Theoretically, you <i>could</i> create this header yourself
            with relative ease, but it's there, so we can just use it.<br><br>
            <b>Open Asset Import Library (assimp)</b><br><br>
            assimp is a library that makes model loading a lot easier. It processes textures and vertices that will be used
            when we want to draw models. Although it is technically a model loader, we still have to do a lot of the work ourselves because we have to convert it
            into a format we can use to draw. assimp is a great help to loading assets.<br><br>
            <b>stb_image</b><br><br>
            stb_image is a single header that is used to load images. We use it alongside assimp to load raw image data in the form of bytes
            to create the textures that are mapped onto the models loaded with assimp.<br><br>
            That's all for the non-standard headers!
