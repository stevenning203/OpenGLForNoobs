            <b>Matrices</b><br><br>
            If you've never done matrices in math before, it is just like a two dimensional array that is mainly used for transformations.
            Matrices are great in computer graphics because they allow you to perform lots and lots of complex transformations in very few
            numbers. The primary operation we will use with matrices is multiplication. Matrices and matrix multiplication is covered
            everywhere math related, so I will not cover that, but I very highly recommend you go and find out how matrices and matrix
            multiplication work in order to understand the inner workings of projection.<br><br>
            <b>Projection</b><br><br>
            Projection is the process of "projecting" the three dimensional points in a three dimensional space onto a two dimensional plane.
            This is one of the matrices that we need, which is called the projection matrix. This matrix is vital to the rendering process
            because it allows us, from the monitor, to view the world as if from a camera. There is quite a bit of math that goes into
            projection matrices, so we'll start from the very beginning.
