            <b>Coding Environment Setup</b><br><br>
            Personally, I use Visual Studio 2019 (VS19) as my text editor and compiler. VS19 has many great features
            for C++ developers but can appear bulky and confusing to use for new users, but I believe it is worth
            the trouble. If you don't already use VS19, then you should download it from <a href = "https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Microsoft's page</a>
            , and select desktop C++ development during the installation. Note that you'll need a somewhat powerful
            computer in order to run it properly. Something like a Raspberry Pi probably wouldn't work too well
            with VS19.<br><br>

            First we have to create our project. To do that, open VS19 and click on "Create a new project". The project
            template we want is "empty project" for C++ on Windows. Name it whatever you want and put it in a safe space.
            Keep the solution name the same as the project name. Next you have to get the headers from the github <a href = "#"><strong>HERE</strong></a>,
            where I packaged them all into a nice zip. Just extract the headers and folders into the project
            directory (where your main.cpp file goes).<br><br>

            Linking the project to all the libraries and headers we need is done through the project settings:<br>
            <img src = "assets/project_properties.png" class = "centered"><br>
            <img src = "assets/additional_include_directories.png" class = "centered"><br>
            <img src = "assets/additional_library_directories.png" class = "centered"><br>
            <img src = "assets/additional_dependencies.png" class = "centered"><br>
            After all that, we can finally include the headers we want and call the function pointers in the libs. We can
            begin writing some code.
